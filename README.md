# Dissertation-Code
The MATLAB code associated with the dissertation completed by Jeff Rodny on 8/24/17

The code could not have been done without Ben St. Clair's help and his code, in which he reimplemented Izhikevich neurons and which codes for creating, connecting, and firing of nuclei of neurons

I plan to clean up the code and upload more in Fall '17
