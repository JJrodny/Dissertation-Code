This selection of code is a replication of the publication Chorley and Seth, 2011

"Chorley, P., & Seth, A. K. (2011). Dopamine-signaled reward predictions generated by competitive excitation and inhibition in a spiking neural network model. Front Comput Neurosci, 5(21.10), 3389."

I worked together with W. Benjamin St. Clair on his implemention of Izhikevich neurons from his book (below) in order to replicate Chorley and Seth, 2011.

"Izhikevich, E. M. (2007). Dynamical systems in neuroscience. MIT press."

In order to run this, simply run "pngNucleiDriverJeff.m"

I have not cleaned up the code for presentation, so please ignore any terrible commenting etc.
